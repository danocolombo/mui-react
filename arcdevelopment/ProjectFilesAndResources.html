Project Files and Resources
Here's the link to all the official documentation for React and Material-UI -- keep these handy!

https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/

Below I also have attached links to GitHub repositories where you can find the final project code -- do note that we will be migrating our project to Next.js later in the course so there is a separate repository for after that is completed.

https://github.com/zreecespieces/material-ui-course-create-react-app -- first version with create-react-app

https://github.com/zreecespieces/material-ui-course-nextjs -- second version with nextjs

For 1080p video, please select the 'auto' video quality option! The course is in full 1080p, but in the options, you will only see 720 and below, and then the 'auto' value. By selecting 'auto' 1080 will be streamed if your display supports it.

Make sure you download the project files attached here, that zip file contains all the icons and animations you'll need for the first project!
